### COUNTER 1: vs Gegenpressing (Klopp 4-3-3)

**Target System:** 4-3-3 Klopp Gegenpressing
**Strategy Type:** Formation + Tactical Adjustment
**Risk Level:** Medium

**Detailed Strategy:**
Use long balls over pressing zones to bypass high press entirely. Target man holds up play to allow team to push forward. Patient buildup outside pressing zones. Avoid quick short passes in own half that trigger pressing traps.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Add extra defensive midfielder for security
- Drop defensive line deeper (low block)
- Goalkeeper long distribution instead of playing out from back
- Target man as primary outlet
- Wide players stay high to stretch press
- Patient possession outside danger zones

**Formation Adjustment:**
- Shift to 4-5-1 or 4-4-2 with deeper defensive line
- Can use 5-3-2 for extra defensive security

**Player Instructions:**
- GK: Long distribution, avoid short passes to CBs
- CBs: Direct passing, avoid dribbling under pressure
- DM: Safe passes, recycling possession outside press
- Wingers: Stay high, stretch opposition
- ST/Target Man: Hold-up play, win aerial duels

**When to Apply:**
- When opponent pressing intensely
- When team struggling with high press
- In big matches vs Liverpool/high-press teams

**Real-World Examples:**
- Real Madrid vs Liverpool (2023 CL) - Ancelotti masterclass
- West Ham vs Liverpool (various matches) - Moyes low-block success
- Atletico Madrid vs Liverpool - Simeone counter-press resistance
