**Formation:** 3-2-4-1
**Category:** Possession
**Style:** Positional Play
**Era:** Modern (2024-2025)

**Philosophy:**
Revolutionary positional play system that transforms from 4-3-3 through inverted fullback movement. The fullback (Zinchenko or Lewis-Skelly) drops into midfield to create a double pivot, while the wingers push high and wide. Creates numerical superiority in buildup and positional dominance.

- Defensive Line Height: 8/10
- Width: 6/10
- Tempo: 8/10
- Risk Level: 7/10
- Possession Target: 65%

**Key Principles:**
- Inverted fullback drops to form double pivot (3-2 shape in buildup)
- Numerical superiority in buildup phase (3+2 = 5 vs 2 forwards)
- Constant rotations between midfielders and forwards
- Half-space occupation by inside forwards
- Third-man runs from midfielders
- Patient buildup with sudden vertical acceleration

**Required Player Profiles:**
